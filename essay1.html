      <h1>The Semantics of Syntax Acquisition</h1>
      <p class="by">By Sachith Mendis</p>
      <p>
        How linked are syntax mastery and semantic understanding in the language
        acquisition process? Historically, American structural linguists—in
        their exploration of the acquisition of language—opted to focus on
        grammatical constructions, delegating the issue of semantics and
        communicative meaning to psychologists. Even as Chomsky upturned this
        linguistic paradigm in the 20th Century—dubbing linguistics a branch of
        cognitive psychology—his ideas on language innateness did not move away
        from this separation: in the nativist view, the issue of constructing
        grammar is unrelated to semantics and expression of meaning.
      </p>

      <p>
        This essay will first present the nativist case for some innate human
        faculty for the acquisition of language—of which Chomskyan universal
        grammar is the extreme (<a href="#bib-chom2000">Chomsky 2000</a>). This
        stance rests on a ‘poverty of the stimulus’ (POS) argument that claims
        there is a large discrepancy between the input and output of the
        language acquisition process. This essay will flesh this out by treating
        empirical examples that demonstrate this discrepancy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many have criticised positing an innate language faculty, however, on
        various grounds (notably: <a href="#bib-schol">Scholz and Pullum</a>;
        <a href="#bib-cow1998">Cowie 1998</a>) including on the huge variation
        between grammars (<a href="#bib-dabr">Da̧browska</a>). This paper will
        explore Tomasello’s critique of innateness, and his proposal that
        instead, children learn language through usage (<a href="#bib-toma2003"
          >2003</a
        >, <a href="#bib-toma2005">2005</a>, <a href="#bib-toma2008">2008</a>). In
        this view, a child’s semantic understanding is intimately tied into how
        she constructs her rules for syntax, because she constructs syntax
        necessarily by using words to communicate about real intentions. This
        essay will show how Tomasello’s account criticises the nativist’s
        argument on their understanding of both the input and output of the
        language acquisition process.
      </p>

      <p>
        As such, this paper will present a survey of both stances, and will
        posit the feasibility of a usage-based account with respect to
        supplementary evidence in favour of the nativist stance. Here it shows
        that the core claim of the nativist argument is accounted for in the
        constructionist frame, but also that there is further empirical work to
        be done to robustly explain some counter-intuitive observations. It does
        this to elucidate these two sides of the language acquisition debate,
        and to explore what the role of semantics in syntax mastery might be.
      </p>

      <h2>Poverty of the Stimulus</h2>

      <p>
        A foundational piece—perhaps the foundational piece—of evidence in
        favour of language innateness is the ‘poverty of the stimulus’ (POS)
        argument which claims that a learner’s input when trying to learn
        language—the utterances of people around them, or the primary linguistic
        data (PLD)—would be inadequate to produce in them an output of a mastery
        of language at a level of sophistication that most people reach after
        childhood. Based on this impoverished input, nativists—like
        Chomsky—posit an innate ‘language acquisition device’ which accounts for
        the language learner’s mastery of language. This innate faculty for
        learning language is domain-specific—its inputs (the PLD) are only
        processed through this ‘module’, and this ‘module’ does not process any
        other sort of input —and has been theorised to function
        (non-exhaustively) through principles and parameters (<a
          href="#bib-baker"
          >Baker</a
        >; <a href="#bib-fodor-jd">J. D. Fodor and Sakas</a>), and Merge
        recursion (<a href="#bib-berwick">Berwick et al.</a>;
        <a href="#bib-chom2004">Chomsky 2004</a>,
        <a href="#bib-chom2012">2012</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Formally, the argument can be articulated as (<a href="#bib-laur"
          >Laurence and Margolis 221</a
        >):
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          In the PLD of a learner of language, there are numerous ‘grammars’
          which are consistent with the target language. The correct grammar the
          learner is trying to learn isn’t the only syntactic set of rules that
          is consistent with the linguistic input she has.
        </li>
        <li>
          The correct grammar isn’t necessarily the simplest, or most intuitive
          of this set of consistent grammars. In this way, an “empiricist
          learner” would not be intuitively drawn to selecting the correct
          grammar out of the set of consistent grammars.
        </li>
        <li>
          The PLD does not consist of the sort of data that would allow the
          learner to correctly choose the appropriate grammar. In addition to
          the learner not hearing enough sentences (especially those that
          demonstrate exceptions in their target grammar), the PLD is of a
          fundamentally different type to what is required.
        </li>
        <li>
          If children were empiricist learners, propositions 1–3 show that they
          would not be able to “reliably arrive at the correct grammar for their
          language.”
        </li>
        <li>Despite this, children do learn to choose the correct grammar.</li>
        <li>
          Children are therefore not “empiricist learners”: there would not be
          enough information in their linguistic input (the PLD) for them to
          acquire a mastery of their relevant grammar to the level that is
          typical.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In this way, the knowledge required to master language, or the knowledge
        acquired by mastering language, is not accounted for the by the PLD.
        There is simply not enough information—there is a poverty of stimulus—in
        a learner’s linguistic input for them to end up with as sophisticated a
        mastery of language as is typical. Because of this, learners can’t be
        “empiricist” (<a href="#bib-laur">Laurence and Margolis 221</a>) in
        their method of language acquisition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laurence and Margolis describe their empiricist learner as “one that
        instantiates an empiricist learning theory. Among other things, such a
        learner wouldn’t have any innate domain-specific knowledge or biases to
        guide her learning and, in particular, wouldn’t have any innate
        language-specific knowledge or biases” (<a href="#bib-laur">221</a>; my
        emphasis). If the discrepancy between the information in a learner’s PLD
        and in their mastery of language is as large as Laurence and Margolis
        claim, then a learner can’t use an “empiricist learning theory” (of
        observation and inference grounded on repetition) to master language.
        Laurence and Margolis take this as evidence that there must be some sort
        of “domain-specific … [or] language-specific knowledge” (<a
          href="#bib-laur"
          >221</a
        >) in humans, as children do in fact master language.
      </p>

      <p>
        This conclusion rests heavily on the discrepancy between the information
        in a learner’s PLD, and in their mastery of language. As such, Laurence
        and Margolis’ treatment of the poverty of the stimulus argument largely
        rests on examples that demonstrate this discrepancy.
      </p>

      <p>
        A central example used in the nativist argument is the construction of a
        question from a sentence with two (or more) auxiliary verbs.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>The car is red.</li>
        <li>Is the car red?</li>
        <li>The park is wet because it rained.</li>
        <li>Is the park wet because it rained?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        From the above, it seems like the rule behind converting a sentence (1,
        3) to a question (2, 4) is to move the first ‘is’ to the beginning of
        the sentence. This rule, however, fails when we add another ‘is’ (a
        second auxiliary verb) to the sentence:
      </p>

      <ol start="5">
        <li>The car that is red is broken.</li>
        <li>* Is the car that red is broken?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In this sentence—whose noun phrase contains the auxiliary verb ‘is’ (the
        noun phrase in (5) is “the car that is red”)—we are supposed to ignore
        the first ‘is’ and instead move the auxiliary verb of the main clause to
        the beginning to form the correct sentence:
      </p>

      <ol start="7">
        <li>Is the car that is red broken?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The construction of this sentence, argue Laurence and Margolis, requires
        a nuanced understanding of what the main clause of a sentence is, and
        what differentiates auxiliary verbs from lexical verbs. They argue—in
        line with Chomsky (<a href="#bib-chom1980">1980, 40</a>)—that young
        learners would not be exposed to enough example sentences to distinguish
        between auxiliary and lexical verbs in this way, and as such wouldn’t be
        able to garner the correct rule to prefer sentence (7) over the more
        intuitive (6): there is a quantitative deficiency in a learner’s input.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laurence and Margolis cite the studies of Karin Stromswold (<a
          href="#bib-strom1990"
          >1990</a
        >, <a href="#bib-strom1999">1999</a>, <a href="#bib-strom2000">2000</a>)
        as evidence that it is uncharacteristic for children to make mistakes
        like those which follow from an inability to distinguish between lexical
        and auxiliary verbs. This is evidence that a child’s mastery of language
        is, at least through the lens of formal grammar, in this example quite
        sophisticated.
      </p>

      <p>
        To finish, some other examples of suggested discrepancies between the
        PLD and formal language are: Differentiating between ‘linguistic’ sounds
        (like syllables, words etc.) and other human-made sounds like coughs,
        whistles, or sneezes; Recognising common units of useful linguistic
        sounds which are expressed differently, like the same word being spoken
        with slurred speech, an accent, whispered, or shouted; The same
        phonological element of a language having different phonetic
        realisations (like the ‘p’ in ‘pit’ and ‘spit’) and different
        phonological elements have the same phonetic realisation (like ‘threw’
        and ‘through’). Even if the specifics of how these are accounted for in
        a nativist account of language acquisition are far from straightforward,
        these difficulties in translating an input of purely phonetical
        linguistic data into a sophisticated understanding of grammar are
        important questions to be posed to the non-nativist.
      </p>

      <h2>Semantics</h2>

      <p>
        Michael Tomasello (<a href="#bib-ibbot">Ibbotson and Tomasello</a>;
        <a href="#bib-toma2003">Tomasello 2003</a>,
        <a href="#bib-toma2005">Tomasello 2005</a>,
        <a href="#bib-toma2008">Tomasello 2008</a>) counters this view. He does
        this on two fronts: first by claiming the input a learner receives is
        not as impoverished as nativists claim, and second by arguing that
        nativists misunderstand grammar as only its formal rules, and hence
        exaggerate how complicated it is for children to have mastered language.
        Tomasello proposes a usage-based theory of language acquisition instead,
        which attributes a child’s ability to learn language to the
        domain-general faculties of “intention-reading” and “pattern-finding”
        (<a href="#bib-toma2008">2008, 69</a>), in contrast to the
        domain-specific language acquisition device posited in the last section.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this view, a child’s capacity to master syntactic rules is intimately
        linked to her approach to garnering semantic understanding. Children
        learn the grammatical structures of a language by using semantically
        loaded language to communicate their intentions to the people around
        them, and by understanding the communicative intentions of people
        talking to them: intention expression and its meaning underlie
        linguistic ability, and an account of linguistic comprehension should be
        predicated on an account of how people communicate in this way. This
        section will go over why semantics should be considered in a theory on
        syntax-learning in order to avoid the ‘linking problem’, and how a
        usage-based theory of language acquisition might work.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a child has innate knowledge of various linguistic objects and
        structures, how are they able to apply this knowledge to the vocabulary
        they have learnt? Proponents of universal grammar (UG) have to explain
        how such a grammar would ‘link’ itself to individual different
        languages. Solutions such as the ‘principles and parameters’ approach
        have been suggested to solve this issue, but none have conclusively
        demonstrated to account for the immense variation we see in language
        across the world (<a href="#bib-toma2008">Tomasello 2008</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        In the nativist schema, even if a leaner were imbued with an innate
        sense of linguistic objects, they have no way of identifying what
        various linguistic objects pertain to which words. For example, how
        would a learner of Sinhalese, who has pre-existent knowledge of what
        verbs, noun phrases, and subjects are, be able to link those objects to
        a particular phonetical realisation, as in the sentence below?
      </p>

      <ol start="8">
        <li><em>Wessa nisaa udyaanaya thethayi.</em></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        While nativists don’t claim that learners would necessarily understand
        (8), there must be some sense in which they are able to recognise
        individual linguistic objects within the sentence—like the noun phrase
        <em>“udyaanaya”</em> (park)—in order to apply their innate knowledge of
        grammatical rules. How does the nativist learner differentiate between
        the two clauses in the sentence <em>“wessa nisaa”</em> (because it
        rained) and “udyaanaya thethayi” (the park is wet), so as to correctly
        append the right clause (<em>“wessa nisaa”</em>) with <em>“-de”</em> to
        make this sentence a question (in a similar way to how we construct (4)
        from (3))?
      </p>

      <p>
        An understanding of grammar as being constructed by “the functional
        dimension [of speech]” (<a href="#bib-toma2005">Tomasello 2005, 184</a>)
        does not fall prey to this ‘linking problem’. Because language serves
        the function of communicating intent, there is a semantic understanding
        of what is being talked about, prior to a mastery of grammar. Any
        understanding of syntactic rules is necessarily attached to the meaning
        of phrases, and what they communicate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tomasello’s (<a href="#bib-toma2008">2008</a>) usage-based theory argues
        grammatical structures arise from using words: linguistic structures are
        constructed by communicating meaning. We can see this hierarchy by
        observing how infants communicate. According to Tomasello, “human
        infants communicate in some fairly sophisticated ways before they have
        acquired any linguistic conventions” (<a href="#bib-toma2009"
          >2009, 70</a
        >), for example by pointing and gesturing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without a ‘linking problem’ the information needed to master a language
        is not disproportionately complex. Children don’t learn formal
        grammatical structures and then link them to particular
        semantically-laden phrases—they use semantically-laden phrases to
        communicate intentions, and implicitly construct a rulebook for
        syntactic structure in the process. In this way, “people use linguistic
        conventions to achieve social ends”, and “meaning-based grammatical
        constructions emerge from individual acts of language use” (<a
          href="#bib-toma2008"
          >Tomasello 2008, 69</a
        >). As such, mastering the complexity of formal grammar (which even
        baffles linguists) is not necessary to master language.
      </p>

      <p>
        To acquire these “linguistic conventions,” children use their faculties
        of “intention-reading” and “pattern-finding” (<a href="#bib-toma2008"
          >Tomasello 2008, 69</a
        >), which are domain-general facets of cognition (in contrast to the
        domain-specific language acquisition device posited by nativists).
        Children use their ability to read intentions to understand what
        speakers around them are trying to communicate. As such, while adults
        might be using linguistic means to communicate to a child who hasn’t
        mastered language, there is still communicative or intentional
        information that the child garners.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because young learners are reading intentions when spoken to, the input
        of this language acquisition process isn’t as impoverished as argued in
        the previous section. There is non-linguistic information that learners
        receive when learning language: the intentions of the person speaking
        to/around them. With this in mind, the examples that constitute the POS
        argument aren’t as salient.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, in understanding how to construct (7), then, children would
        not make the mistake made in (6), because they would be referring to an
        object (a red car). They would have the concepts of ‘the red car’ and
        something being ‘broken,’ and would combine them as in (5). In
        constructing a question out of this, they would still have these two
        concepts, and the re-ordering of verbs—with each verb being associated
        to either ‘the red car’ or ‘broken’—would follow a pattern that has been
        constructed on the basis of similar concepts (as in (2)). In a sence,
        the child would have learnt to distinguish what, for example, the noun
        phrase of a sentence was, not because they formally understand its
        structure in syntactical terms, but rather because—by the time they
        start learning language—they would have become accustomed to
        communicating about real objects, like ‘the red car’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, children use pattern finding—a skill they might use for other
        cognitive tasks, like pairing a long curved yellow object with the taste
        of a banana—to create “abstract linguistic schemas or constructions”
        from an input of “individual utterances” (<a href="#bib-toma2008"
          >Tomasello 2008, 70</a
        >). It is by means of their pattern finding faculty that children are
        able to implicitly extrapolate individual instances of grammatical
        sentences into robust rules with which they can interpret and create
        completely novel sentences.
      </p>

      <h2>Supplementary Arguments</h2>

      <p>
        Laurence and Margolis further argue in favour of language innateness
        with a set of supplementary arguments that favour the nativist position.
        This section will deal with two sets of related arguments, and explore
        them from the perspective of a Tomasello style usage-based theory of
        language acquisition.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>“All Normal Children Acquire Language”</em> (<a href="#bib-laur"
          >Laurence and Margolis 234</a
        >) and
        <em>“Language Acquisition Is Independent of Intelligence”</em> (<a
          href="#bib-laur"
          >237</a
        >). This pertinent observation likely served as the impetus for the
        postulation of an innate faculty for the acquisition of language: it
        seems remarkable that all children (barring a miniscule minority) master
        language, seemingly independently of various contingencies, such as
        education. Spoken language is not taught, like other cognitive skills
        are (e.g. maths, playing the piano, or even reading). It is unique in
        that children are able to consistently acquire a mastery of spoken
        language, and the level of mastery between individuals with wildly
        different capacities in other cognitive tasks (e.g. maths etc.) is not
        proportionately different.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is consistent with a usage-based account of language acquisition.
        All social children need to communicate their intentions, and are
        communicated to linguistically, and as such have the basis for
        constructing grammar through use. Other cognitive skills (e.g.
        proficiency in maths etc.) are not gathered through usage in the manner
        spoken language is: language is still a unique cognitive faculty in this
        view, as in the nativist view, and hence its unrelatedness to this sort
        of learned cognitive faculty is unsurprising.
      </p>

      <p>
        We would expect, however, cognitive skills developed through the
        faculties of intention reading and pattern finding to exhibit a similar
        sort of ubiquity to language mastery, or at least to be more universal
        than the sort of learned skill mentioned above. On the face of it, this
        seems like a reasonable thing to expect to observe, but this is an
        empirical question that proponents would benefit from exploring.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>“Language Acquisition Exhibits Ordered Developmental Stages”</em>
        (<a href="#bib-laur">Laurence and Margolis 235</a>) and
        <em>“Critical Period Effects”</em> (<a href="#bib-laur">236</a>). The
        fact that the language acquisition process is very similar in all
        learners, again regardless of environment, is an argument in favour of
        the nativist. If children learned empirically, we would expect their
        progress to be contingent on what they’ve been exposed, what methods
        they’ve used to construct their grammar, and sheer luck. This is not
        what we observe: deaf children and blind children, for example, seem to
        reach language milestones at similar times to other children, despite
        “profound differences in learning environment” (<a href="#bib-laur"
          >235</a
        >). Native signers consistently have a better lifelong grasp of grammar
        than early or late signers, and the cases of Genie and Chelsea (as
        described in Laurence and Margolis (<a href="#bib-laur">236</a>)) never
        mastering grammar because of their late exposure, are demonstrative of
        how the process of language acquisition conforms to “a fairly rigid
        biologically determined timeframe” (<a href="#bib-laur">236</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        These observations prove difficult for Tomasello’s case of language
        acquisition. If linguistic mastery is gathered by use, why doesn’t
        Chelsea’s (for example) exposure to and use of language lead to her
        constructing sophisticated grammatical rules? If there were a parallel
        “critical period” for the faculties of intention reading and pattern
        finding, proponents should be able to demonstrate some other cognitive
        skills that are similarly time sensitive.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, the case of second language acquisition might be more
        consistent with a usage-based account. From a usage-based perspective,
        it might be harder for adults to acquire a second language because
        learning a second language without using it to communicate something is
        removing the semantic element of language acquisition from the process.
        Studies on immigrants to the U.S. argue that second language acquisition
        correlates better with factors like “length of residence in the new
        country” (<a href="#bib-cow2017">Cowie 2017</a>). In this scenario,
        second language learners might be able to better construct a new grammar
        through genuine communicative acts in the target language, because they
        are also able to read the intentions of whoever is speaking to them.
      </p>

      <p class="break">*</p>

      <p>
        Regardless of which side of this heated debate rife with polemic,
        partisanship, and politics philosophers find themselves on, they must
        concede that the idea of innateness, fuelled by a POS argument, has
        changed how scientists and philosophers alike approach linguistics and
        cognitive science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through an exploration of the POS argument, it’s clear that there is
        some merit to the nativist cause. A strict behaviourist account of
        language acquisition (closest to Laurence and Margolis’ empiricist), for
        example, seems utterly incapable of accounting for the complexity of
        speech based only on linguistic inputs: it seems impossible that an
        empiricist learner of this kind could acquire language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tomasello’s proposal of a usage-based theory of language acquisition,
        however, presents a compelling counter-argument It claims the difference
        between input and output does not warrant a language acquisition device.
        In this view, a child has access to an array of non-linguistic data when
        constructing grammar in addition to the nativist’s exclusively
        linguistic input, increasing the quality and quantity of input she has
        for the language acquisition process. This non-linguistic input takes
        the form of intentions and patterns, which help her understand the
        meaning behind communicative acts, and extrapolate individual utterances
        into a set of syntactic rules respectively. Through the use of language
        to express her intentions, the learner implicitly recognising patterns
        and builds syntactic structures to better communicate; she does not
        learn formal grammatical rules before communicating her intentions about
        things, and as such mastering language is not as complicated as it
        seems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because semantics and syntax are so intertwined in this view, there is
        no linking problem, which is a problem nativists have yet to
        satisfactorily solve. As an innate theory of language acquisition
        necessarily separates between syntax acquisition and semantic
        understanding, it must account for how the two are linked for its
        application of innate syntactic rules to be applicable to particular
        phonetic utterances.
      </p>

      <p>
        A comparison of the two approaches to language acquisition shows that
        the usage-based theory is consistent with what is arguably the core
        argument in the nativist schema, whereas its application to what seems
        to be a ‘critical period’ in the acquisition of language, and other
        time-sensitive aspects of the process needs development. Given the
        divergence of theoretical ideas on the matter of language innateness,
        these matters warrant empirical exploration, which will serve to make
        the field less speculative and hopefully will shed light on how humans
        learn to speak.
