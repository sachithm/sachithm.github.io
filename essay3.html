          Democracy in the Spinozist State

        Spinoza’s political work surveys in detail various sorts of government,
        proposes effective constitutions, and looks to history as well as
        anthropological first principles to garner how societies ought to work.
        He deals with many issues a society might face in forming a state: what
        the state of nature is (Curley 1991), the role of religion in society
        (James 2012), and how important freedom of thought and expression might
        be (Curley 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
        A popular aspect of Spinoza’s work has been his treatment of democracy.
        Proponents of Spinoza as a democrat argue that his notions of original
        democracy and the multitude are clear indicators that Spinoza favours a
        democratic sort of government (most notably Negri and Hardt 2000; 2004);
        opponents are not so sure these concepts serve as endorsements (Field).
      </p>
      <p>
        This paper will argue that to understand Spinoza’s approach to society
        and the formation of government, it is imperative to dive into his
        conception of nature and natural rights. Through this, we can understand
        that individuals form societies to empower themselves, and that a
        state’s existential dependence on its citizens frames its effectiveness,
        which can be measured by its absolute power.
      </p>
      <p>
        A reading of Spinoza’s politics as fundamentally grounded on democratic
        principles—the idea that <em>any</em> sort of government’s worth is
        predicated on empowering its citizens—makes sense of Spinozist
        absolutism, and elucidates the link between a society’s original
        democracy, and its various manifestations of sovereignty thereafter,
        which also confusingly include democracy. This essay will distinguish
        between a more fundamental, first-order sort of democracy upon which
        <em>any</em> social arrangement is founded, and the practical
        organisational structure of a sovereign in the form of a second-order
        democracy. Through this lens, we can understand Spinoza’s anachronistic
        support of second-order democracy, the merits of an aristocracy, and how
        the best monarchies are, paradoxically, democratic.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Nature and Rights
      </h2>
      <p>
        For Spinoza, “the <em>supreme</em> [my emphasis] law of nature is that
        each thing strives to persevere in its state” (TTP 16.4). In line with
        his theory of <em>conatus</em>, as expounded on in the <em>Ethics</em>,
        Spinoza argues that every individual—fundamentally, as a law of
        nature—works to persevere in her being, or to empower herself.[1]
      </p>
      <p>
        The toolkit an individual has to serve this “supreme” end is, in the
        Spinozian view, <em>anything</em> she can do (ibid.). Spinoza makes the
        rather unusual claim that this toolkit is an individual’s “supreme
        right” (ibid.): if, after all, someone has been endowed by nature the
        ability to do something, they have the right, <em>by nature</em>, to
        exercise that ability. For Spinoza, such a “Right of nature” is nothing
        more than “the laws of nature themselves” (TP 2.4)—individuals have a
        natural right to do anything physically possible.[2] Individuals, by
        empowering themselves, increase their natural rights, which they in turn
        use to further empower themselves.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s a caveat. Even though everything an individual does is in the
        service of her <em>conatus</em>, she might not have the right
        understanding to legitimately, or most effectively, empower herself in
        this way. Indeed, because “[i]nadequate and confused ideas follow with
        the same necessity as adequate, or clear and distinct ideas” (E II P36)
        an individual <em>probably</em> has an inadequate (and hence false
        (P35)) idea of how to empower herself. If the effectiveness with which
        we empower ourselves is contingent on how adequate our ideas on the
        topic are, it would follow in the Spinozian schema that the more we
        utilise reason[4] to figure out how to empower ourselves, the more
        effectively we will do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does reason tell us, then? Spinoza argues that: “If two men make an
        agreement with one another and join forces, they can do more together,
        and hence, have more right over nature than either does alone” (TP
        2.13). Through co-operation, each individual can empower herself—for
        example, two people might be able to lift a heavy object that neither
        could lift alone—and so reason would have it that individuals
        <em>should</em> enter into co-operative alliances with each other. There
        is no need to justify this union with concepts of altruism or
        compassion—it is completed founded on self-empowerment. As Spinoza puts
        it: “When each man most seeks his own advantage for himself, then men
        are most useful to one another” (E IV P35 Cor. 2). Even on this level of
        basic co-operation, Spinoza hints at a “social order” being useful to
        the end of “doing many things more easily” (TTP 5.18).
      </p>
      <h2>
        A Sovereign and a State
      </h2>
      <p>
        As with Thomas Hobbes, Spinoza doesn’t think much of a pre-societal
        state of nature—he thinks such a state would be extremely disempowering.
        Individuals would not have much power to do anything, because they would
        “live anxiously” (TTP 16.13), and would expend all their energy
        protecting themselves from others who are “permitted to do whatever
        [they like]” (16.12). In fact, for Spinoza, individuals in a state of
        nature have the <em>right</em> to do “anything appetite urges” (TTP
        16.9), including “hostilities, hatreds, anger and deceptions” (16.13).
        Life in such a place would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and
        short” (Leviathan xiii).
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be empowering for everyone, then, if individuals agreed “to
        rein in their appetites, insofar as those appetites urge something
        harmful to someone else” (TTP 16.14). In addition to the sort of
        co-operation described in the previous section, Spinoza proposes that a
        further agreement between individuals—to each give up <em>some</em> of
        their natural rights, in order for each to <em>gain more</em> natural
        rights (by not having to focus so heavily on survival)—is a reasonable
        way for an individual to empower herself. This Spinozist arithmetic
        implies that any social agreement is only pertinent while it empowers
        its participants: if individuals do not <em>gain</em> more natural
        rights than they have lost by entering into the pact, the agreement
        would be unreasonable, and its basis irrational (TTP 16.20).[5]
      </p>
      <p>
        Spinoza posits that a sovereign with “supreme right over everyone” is
        needed to <em>enforce</em> this foregoing of rights in
        <em>everyone</em>, even if “by force … [or] by fear” (TTP 16.24).[6]
        This sovereign forms the basis of the state, and is to whom[7] each
        individual transfers their natural rights to.[8] The laws this sovereign
        makes—the natural rights it forbids an individual from exercising—are
        civil laws, and would protect the sort of rights that Grotius would call
        natural rights, such as justice. Spinoza’s sovereign ostensibly can’t be
        bound by the laws it creates (for example, it should be able to kill as
        punishment, even if it outlaws killing in all circumstances) (TTP
        16.24-26), which <em>de jure</em> gives it the ability to do whatever it
        wants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the state, then, is the empowerment of its citizens.
        Spinoza can be unclear on this across his work (“the end of the Republic
        is really freedom” (TTP 20.12); “the end of the civil condition, which
        is nothing other than peace and security of life” (TP 5.2)), but we can
        see these other ends of freedom and security as serving a more
        fundamental end of empowerment. After all, it is the “supreme law of
        nature” that people seek to empower themselves, and people do this “not
        on account of anything else, but only of itself” (TTP 16.4).
      </p>
      <p>
        As before, however, this state is only warranted if it secures for
        individuals more natural rights than it takes away from them. While this
        is a very hard requirement to miss—a state would have to be extremely
        corrupt or dangerous to disempower its citizens more than in a state of
        nature—this foundation on public empowerment is integral to Spinoza’s
        democratic notion of sovereignty.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Absolute Power
      </h2>
      <p>
        What form should a sovereign take? Should it be a strong individual, who
        can make decisions on behalf of the people, like Hobbes’ Leviathan, or
        should it be directly democratic, with the popular will of the people
        being taken as something like the majority in a vote? Spinoza discusses
        three types of sovereign in his <em>Tractatus Politicus</em>, but his
        untimely death while writing chapter eleven on democracy leaves the
        question of the best form of government frustratingly ambiguous. He
        seems to claim that democracy leads to a “completely absolute state” (TP
        11.1), but whether this serves as an endorsement is unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is it that makes a state absolute, and does this make a state
        better? Through a distinction between first-order and second-order
        democracies, this paper understands ‘absolute power’ as a litmus test
        for how well a state works in its citizens’ interests, and as such, how
        stable and empowered it is itself. This separation of democracies makes
        clear exactly how Spinoza endorses democracy: while there are advantages
        to organising a government as a second-order democracy, it is imperative
        that <em>any</em> sort of sovereign should be democratic in its rule,
        because <em>every</em>
        social arrangement is founded fundamentally as a first-order democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In what way does a state’s historical first-order democracy affect its
        functioning? As discussed in the last section, a social agreement is
        only reasonable if it empowers its participants overall, but it is
        unlikely that a state would ever disempower its citizens more than a
        state of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with individuals, there are different degrees to which a state can be
        effective. Chapter 5 of the <em>Tractatus Politicus</em> begins by
        drawing this parallel: a state “is most powerful, and most its own
        master, when it’s founded on and directed by reason,” where an entity’s
        being its own master serves “to preserve [it]self as much as possible”
        (5.1). Indeed, “[t]he ‘strength’ of a State … is defined by its capacity
        to endure” (Balibar 1998, 35). It becomes useful here to distinguish
        between a state’s natural right, and its absolute power. While a
        state—like an individual—has a right by nature to do anything it’s
        capable of doing, it is in reality restricted by its existence being
        predicated to serve the people. Insofar as the state serves this end,
        and governs in such a way as to systematically take into account what is
        best for its citizens, it will have more absolute power, and will be
        more stable.
      </p>
      <p>
        When discussing freedom of thought and expression, for example, Spinoza
        argues that “by right [a state] can rule with the utmost violence, and
        condemn citizens to death for the slightest of reasons. … [But], because
        they can’t do these things without great danger to the whole state, we
        can also deny that they have the <em>absolute power</em> [my emphasis]
        to do such things” (TTP 20.7). Because a state can’t fully control how
        its citizens think—even though, Spinoza concedes, free thought can be
        dangerous (TTP 20.10)—it would be foolish for it to try and make enemies
        out of free thinkers. While such an authoritarian state might be
        stronger in the short term, it will breed dissent, which could lead to
        unrest or the rise of rival factions, which would disempower the state
        overall. A state’s purpose is to empower its citizens by freeing them of
        the worry of violence—not to inflict it on them—and in doing so empower
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if some Huxleyan ‘World State’ could non-violently control how
        people think, Spinoza would argue that this is ultimately disempowering.
        It might be the case that individuals wouldn’t protest or rebel, but
        reason is ultimately the most empowering tool out of an individual’s
        natural rights. By stripping them of this, the state disempowers itself,
        perhaps leaving it weaker to other states, or at the very least not able
        to do what it potentially could do (e.g., perhaps the ‘World State’
        would be ill prepared for an imminent asteroid impact, because it
        suppressed free thought). A state should strive to “enable [its
        citizens’] to use their reason freely” (TTP 20.12), and should increase
        its citizens’ natural rights, if only to empower itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        A state has more absolute power, then, if it works to serve its
        <em>raison d’être</em>. It’s in a state’s best interest to maximise its
        absolute power, because empowered individuals result in an empowered
        society. As it were, absolute power is a metric by which we can
        understand how effectively a state is empowering its citizens, which in
        parallel exhibits how much a state is serving its own “supreme end” (TTP
        16.4): state empowerment and empowerment of the multitude are, in
        effect, the same for Spinoza.
      </p>
      <p>
        This correlative relationship is a result of the state’s fundamentally
        democratic basis. In describing how a social order first gains
        sovereignty, Spinoza explicitly describes its form as a “Democracy” (TTP
        16.26), and claims it was “formed without any alienation of right” (TTP
        16.8 Cambridge trans. 200; III/193).[10] He goes on to talk about a
        second-order sort of (constitutional) democracy in the <em>TTP</em>, and
        describes it as “the most natural state, and the one which approache[s]
        most nearly the freedom nature concedes to everyone” (16.36). It is no
        coincidence that the second-order sort of democracy has the most
        absolute (<em>de facto</em>) power (TP 11.1), minimises the restriction
        of its subjects’ natural rights, and is the most similar to a
        first-order original democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, in judging <em>all</em> sorts of government in the
        <em>TP</em> , “[e]very form of state is submitted to the test whether it
        can effectively respond and do justice to … the ‘power of the multitude’
        that generates and enables state power” (Saar 10). As it were, all
        governments in the <em>TP</em> are judged on how democratic they are,
        and Spinoza consistently advises sovereigns to be more democratic.
        Spinoza exhibits this fundamentally democratic character when describing
        a monarchy in the <em>TP</em>, which is summarised in paragraph
        <em>6.8</em>:[11] “a Monarch will be most his own master, when he’s most
        attentive to the well-being of the multitude.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Constitutionally, Spinoza implements this sort of representational
        well-being in, for example, the “King’s Counsellors … [who] should be
        chosen only from the citizens” (TP 6.15), who make up a sort of advisory
        council—essentially to keep the monarch in check, and make sure she
        “decree[s] for the public good” (6.17). Further, the judicial branch of
        government ought to be split and formed of another council (TP 6.26),
        which seems to be a check to prevent authoritarian behaviour from the
        monarch. Indeed, the “only Rule” or advice Spinoza would give a monarch
        is “that the King’s power is determined only by the power of the
        multitude, and is preserved by the multitude’s support” (TP 7.31). As
        Martin Saar puts it, “the king is radically dependent on his subjects”
        (10), and as such a good monarchy is fundamentally democratic.
      </p>
      <p>
        An aristocracy, for Spinoza, has more absolute power than a monarchy. In
        <em>TP 8.6</em>, Spinoza compares the two sorts of sovereign, and a
        pertinent conclusion he draws is that an aristocracy “is absolute, or
        comes nearest to being absolute.” This makes sense, as a Spinozian
        aristocracy is a sovereign organised such that “rule is not by one man,
        but by certain men selected from the multitude” (TP 8.1). These
        “Patricians” are chosen freely by current members, and form a “Council”
        (TP 8.3), which serves as the legislative centre of the state. Such a
        council would have more absolute power than a monarch because it would
        be made up of citizens, and the well-being of the people would be
        directly considered in legislation. Even a good monarchy, with an active
        and representative set of counsellors, runs the risk of a bad egg that
        could have inadequate ideas of how to empower herself and her state.
        This, unexpectedly, is something Machiavelli warns against: “A prince
        who is able to do what he wishes … is apt to behave like a madman”
        (Curley 1995, 332). Aristocracies systematically protect against this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The argument in favour of second-order democracies is similar. In the
        <em>TP</em>, a democracy is also ruled by some council of citizens, but
        this council consists of a legally defined group of people (11.2). This
        form of government is emphatically not representative: if the group was
        ‘all adults over 18’, the state would resemble some sort of direct
        democracy where every adult citizen has “the right to vote in the
        supreme Council, and to manage the business of the state” (ibid.).[12]
        While this birth right to direct state affairs seems similar to the
        hereditary rule of kings, a democracy can actually be better than a
        realistic aristocracy. In the latter, council members could keep
        electing other citizens who might agree with some corrupt policy,
        whereas in a democracy, <em>everyone</em>—including those with different
        opinions to the status quo—has the right to vote in the council. Even
        though an aristocracy of well-minded, rational patricians would be
        Spinoza’s ideal government (ibid.)[13]—much more akin to a modern
        meritocracy—he is not optimistic that such a set up would be realistic.
        While a democracy might not rule itself the most effectively, it
        systematically protects against the sort of corrupt, institutional abuse
        of governance likely in an aristocracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it is worth nothing that it might not always be best to risk
        unrest to change an established monarchy or aristocracy into a
        democracy, despite the latter’s strengths. Spinoza often says things
        like: “thought the subject may think the decrees of the Commonwealth
        unfair, he’s nevertheless bound to carry them out” (TP 3.5), in support
        of a sovereign’s exercising their
        <em>de jure</em> power. This is not only a testament to how almost any
        civil order is better than a state of nature (TP 3.6), but also a
        reminder that a government organised as a second-order democracy is not
        the only way citizens can have their best-interests taken into account.
        Indeed, it might be better to suggest and advise constitutional reform
        that makes a monarchy or aristocracy more democratic—in line with the
        fundamental basis of the state—instead of risking unrest and bloodshed
        for structural change, as the English did (TTP 18.33). As it were,
        tyranny is a symptom of a society’s inadequate ideas, and not of its
        second-order organisational structure.
      </p>
      <p class="break">*</p>
      <p>
        A democracy, then, is the best way to realistically run a state. Based
        on its structure alone, it has the most absolute power of all the sorts
        of sovereign considered: “[it provides the] optimal political
        circumstances for cultivating a free way of life” (James 2008, 142). In
        comparison to monarchies and aristocracies, a democracy is
        constitutionally designed to cater for the well-being of the multitude,
        and systematically protects itself from abuse by parties with inadequate
        ideas of how to empower themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any manifestation of sovereign, however, can be democratic, empowering,
        and absolutely powerful, as long as it acts on behalf of the multitude.
        Indeed, most of Spinoza’s work in the <em>TP</em> is outlining effective
        monarchies and aristocracies in this light. Through an understanding of
        any social agreement as predicated by an essentially democratic
        arrangement—in turn understood through Spinozian natural rights—we can
        understand how Spinoza’s politics is fundamentally democratic, even if
        he does not endorse organising a government <em>necessarily</em> as a
        democracy. Any effective state must honour its democratic beginnings in
        order to empower itself, through its citizens; while the advantages of a
        second-order democracy are highly context dependent, the advantages of
