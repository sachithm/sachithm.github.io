      <p>
        Nietzsche is lying to us in his <em>On the Genealogy of Morality</em>.
        The book is ostensibly presented as a historical work on the origins of
        morality, but even in the subtitle Nietzsche betrays the work’s
        polemical nature. An interpretation of Nietzsche’s genealogy as
        historically true is questionable, primarily because he affords so
        little attention to historical detail, and as a result, any insight into
        genuine history garnered from the <em>Genealogy</em> has to be extremely
        interpretative.
      </p>

      <p>
        What purpose does genealogy serve then? This paper will argue that there
        is instrumental value in a genealogical exploration, in that—even if
        historically inaccurate—such an endeavour calls into question the
        legitimacy of morality. It does this by showing that morality could
        arise from contingent, emotive conditions that do not reliably generate
        true facts, and by dismantling the unquestionable authority of
        morality—by questioning its origins. Neither of these need the genealogy
        to be historically accurate, as much as they need it to be feasible as a
        historical narrative.
      </p>

      <p>
        This paper then goes on to show that the genealogy’s support of
        Nietzsche’s moral critique goes further than just introducing doubt. A
        reading of Nietzsche’s genealogy as intentionally deceptive, and as a
        polemical tool to lower his reader’s defences explains why he chooses to
        frame most of the book as a genealogical endeavour, and makes sense of
        some of Nietzsche’s more confusing passages. This essay will explore the
        <em>Genealogy’s</em> preface, the last four sections of its second
        treatise, as well as its summary chapter in <em>Ecce Homo</em> to this
        end, and will show that, while Nietzsche’s genealogy is not necessarily
        historical, it is still crucially important to his project.
      </p>

      <h2>History?</h2>

      <p>
        <em>On the Genealogy of Morality</em> purports itself to be a historical
        work—insofar as genealogy is related to history—and it is tempting to
        use its historical project as a basis for the critique of morality it
        presents. When Nietzsche introduces the book by claiming it to be about
        his “thoughts on the <em>origins</em> of our moral prejudices” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >GM P:2</a
        >), and a reader finds that the work critiques the value of morality, it
        is intuitive for her to think that it is this exploration of an origin
        that grounds such a critique.
      </p>

      <p>
        Michael Forster argues that “the historical strength of Nietzsche’s
        thesis has not been well appreciated” (<a href="#bibliography">354</a>).
        Forster claims that Nietzsche is referring to Palestine around the time
        of Christ as the setting for the slave revolt, where the master morals
        of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ are inverted into the slave morals of ‘evil’ and
        ‘good’ respectively. In this period, Palestine “was thickly settled with
        <em>poleis</em>, or cities, whose inhabitants were largely Greeks, and
        was in addition ruled by the Romans” (<a href="#bibliography">ibid.</a
        >), while the Jewish population were oppressed by both groups. It might
        be this relationship between the Romans and the Jews that Nietzsche
        alludes to in section 13 of the first essay in his analogy of the “great
        birds of prey” and the “lambs”. If Nietzsche was talking about this
        period, how are we to understand the nature of the slave revolt? Was it
        a singular event, such as the Jewish revolts circa. 70 CE during which
        the second temple was destroyed, and after which some claim the rabbis
        began compiling the Talmud (<a href="#bibliography">Grayzel 193</a>)?
      </p>

      <p>
        Another compelling interpretation of the slave revolt is that is
        occurred during the Babylonian exile, when the Jews were scattered
        across Mesopotamia after a crushing military defeat in 605 BCE. If this
        were the case, perhaps the slave revolt was a gradual process during the
        exile, when the Jewish conception of Yahweh changed from a poly-theistic
        local god to a mono-theistic universal God. It’s in this change,
        arguably, that the Jewish deity stopped being a tribal god for good
        fortune—particularly in war—and became a ‘God of all gods’ which
        moralised against traditionally tribal values.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is unlikely that a strict historicist interpretation of the
        <em>Genealogy</em>, as in Forster and Schuringa, is sound. Put simply:
        the imprecision with which Nietzsche speaks historically, and the
        ambiguity in his narrative that means a historical reading must be
        extremely interpretative, as above, does not seem like the work of a
        sincere historian. It is unclear why Nietzsche would not be clearer in
        his history, if he is referring so specifically to a particular
        historical period.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adversaries to a historicist reading argue that the
        <em>Genealogy</em> would commit the “genetic fallacy” by equating
        morality’s suspicious past with reason to be suspicious of it today.
        Neil Sinhababu claims that Nietzsche does <em>not</em> make this
        mistake. Rather, the <em>Genealogy</em> shows that “moral beliefs arise
        through a process that does not reliably generate true belief” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >270</a
        >) because they are the manifestations of highly emotive responses to an
        extremely trying situation (slavery; the Babylonian exile). This
        “Unreliability Argument” (<a href="#bibliography">ibid.</a>) undermines
        the validity of supposed moral facts generated in this way. Even if his
        genealogy is not completely historically accurate, Nietzsche
        convincingly shows that a value system as foundational as morality
        <em>could</em> arise from an emotionally contingent setting, which at
        the very least warrants questioning its validity.
      </p>

      <p>
        But does this mean Nietzsche’s basis for critiquing morality rests on
        his genealogy? Sinhababu finds a historical reading to be an
        inappropriate basis for a genuine critique. In Sinhababu’s reading,
        “Nietzsche regards the nobles’ moral beliefs as unjustified and false as
        well,” because they are similarly formed by a process “driven by
        powerful emotions” (<a href="#bibliography">266</a>). He concludes that
        “Nietzsche approves of the noble morality not because it is true or
        because the nobles are epistemically justified in accepting it, but
        because it promotes the
        <em>active, proud, strong-willed lifestyle</em> [my emphasis] that the
        nobles enjoy” (<a href="#bibliography">267</a>). On what basis would
        Nietzsche praise an “active, proud, strong-willed lifestyle” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >ibid.</a
        >)?
      </p>

      <p>
        Raymond Geuss argues that history has “genuine, if strictly limited,
        value” (<a href="#bibliography">285</a>), and that Nietzsche is
        sincerely trying to be accurate. But Guess similarly does not accept
        that such a history—even if genuine—would form a basis for Nietzsche’s
        critique of morality. Instead, the critique of the value of morality is
        that “morality has overwhelmingly negative value as a major hindrance to
        the enhancement of life” (<a href="#bibliography">285</a>)—<em>not</em>
        that morality has a dubious past. Here we can begin to see how Nietzsche
        grounds his critique: the key lies in his concepts of life affirmation
        and denial, of which the former leads to “the enhancement of life” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >ibid.</a
        >) or an “active, proud, strong-willed lifestyle” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >Sinhababu, 267</a
        >).
      </p>

      <p>
        In line with Sinhababu and Geuss’ readings, Nietzsche seems to doubt
        grounding a critique of values on their history. In
        <em>The Gay Science</em> he says: “A morality could even have grown
        <em>out of</em> an error, and the realization of this fact would not so
        much as touch the problem of its value” (<a href="#bibliography">345</a
        >).
      </p>

      <p>
        Why, then, does Nietzsche frame his exploration as a
        genealogical/historical endeavour when, ultimately, such an account
        fails to ground the critique he is aiming for? Alexander Nehamas points
        out that Nietzsche’s genealogy helps de-solidify the foundation morality
        is built on, whereby it is taken as <em>a priori</em>, or ‘categorical’,
        or a ‘universal’ truth. For Nehamas: “The <em>Genealogy</em> contains a
        sustained effort on Nietzsche’s part to show that morality is a subject
        fit for interpretation” (<a href="#bibliography">58</a>). What Nietzsche
        is doing in his critique—unlike traditional moral philosophers in the
        canon—is calling into question the value of morality <em>itself</em>, as
        opposed to particular moral values. This upheaval of morality as
        <em>a priori</em> is what allows Nietzsche to posit it as a relative
        <em>nature</em>, and to inspire his readers to overcome what has been
        utterly ingrained into them: “for those who employ critical history for
        the sake of life, there is even a noteworthy consolation: that of
        knowing that this first nature was once a second nature and that every
        victorious second nature will become a first” (<a href="#bibliography"
          >HL 3</a
        >).
      </p>

      <p>
        There is instrumental value, then, in Nietzsche’s genealogy, as
        acknowledging the sheer fact that one can even <em>think</em> of
        morality as having a history, is a step towards understanding “<em
          >that there are no moral facts whatever</em
        >” (<a href="#bibliography">TI “Improvers”: 1</a>, Nietzsche’s
        emphasis). This stance makes an important step: it shows that even
        though Nietzsche’s project is ostensibly historical, genealogy is used
        as a tool to support his real critique of morality on the basis that it
        is life-denying.
      </p>

      <h2>Deception</h2>

      <p>
        To what extent, then, is genealogy used to support Nietzsche’s moral
        critique? Does it do more than just undermine morality’s basis, and pit
        morality as unlikely to be true, as in Sinhababu? Nietzsche does, after
        all, frame his entire book through this genealogical lens. Ken Gemes
        argues that Nietzsche’s historical account is intentionally deceptive,
        and that it acts to distract the reader from the real focus of his
        critique: modern readers’ “ultimate embodiment of the ascetic ideal” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >191</a
        >). We can see this by understanding Nietzsche’s genealogy as ultimately
        polemical, or a rhetorical tool for distracting his audience. Through
        this lens, Nietzsche’s contradictions and curious changes in topic in
        the preface and the end of the second treatise make sense, and his
        flagrant historical inaccuracy proves not to be a problem to his
        critique of morality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nietzsche is intentionally misleading his reader in the
        <em>Genealogy</em>. “We are unknown to ourselves” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >GM P:1</a
        >) is how he chooses to start the book: this could be saying that “we”
        don’t know our (moral) history, or—in line with our moving away from a
        historical understanding of genealogy—it could be signalling towards
        some other aspect of ourselves that we’re not cognizant of. The first
        section of the preface ends with: “We remain of necessity
        <em>strangers to ourselves</em> [my emphasis] … with respect to
        ourselves we are not ‘knowers’ … [Nietzsche’s ellipsis]” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >ibid.</a
        >), and as if in the same breath, the second section starts—with a
        markedly different tone, and a switch in topic from “us” not knowing
        ourselves to “the <em>origins</em> of our moral prejudices” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >GM P:2</a
        >). This sort of manic tonal switch is not infrequent in Nietzsche’s
        work, but it is disconcerting how he does not explain his opening
        remarks. As Gemes puts it, “the whole theme of our being strangers to
        ourselves is quickly and quietly dropped” (<a href="#bibliography"
          >2006, 192</a
        >).
      </p>

      <p>
        In his summary of the <em>Genealogy</em> in <em>Ecce Homo</em>,
        Nietzsche says that its three essays are "<em>uncannier</em> [my
        emphasis] than anything else written so far” with regards to
        “expression, intention, and the art of surprise,” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >EH “Genealogy”</a
        >). He describes the book as "<em>calculated</em> to mislead: cool,
        scientific, even ironic, deliberately foreground, deliberately holding
        off” (<a href="#bibliography">ibid.</a>): it is difficult to read these
        lines and not be unnerved by the idea that Nietzsche might be hiding
        something.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why would Nietzsche want to deceive his reader? Because the subject of
        the <em>Genealogy’s</em> critique is uncannily close to home.
        Nietzsche’s critique centres on his reader—not her ancestors—and, as
        such, he must be indirect in how he presents it to avoid provoking a
        “reflex denial and a refusal to countenance his message” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >Gemes, 192</a
        >). Gemes also argues that Nietzsche—in proto-Freudian fashion—believes
        that subconscious or “deeper forms of realization … are necessary for
        genuine change” (<a href="#bibliography">192</a>). A genealogical
        narrative, as it were, is a rhetorical tool employed by Nietzsche to
        lower his reader’s guard, and to affect them on a sub-conscious level.
        In this view, the <em>Genealogy</em> is not intended as a handbook for
        healers that outlines an issue, its symptoms, and its cures; Nietzsche’s
        book <em>is</em> the medicine that will, through subtlety and
        subterfuge, make readers grow aware of their sickness, critical of its
        ill-worth, and resistant to its manifestation as modern compassionate
        morality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zooming out, it can be useful to track Nietzsche’s tone through the book
        to see how his object of criticism shifts from an ancestral Other to the
        modern reader, and how the book shifts from deceptive to explicit. The
        first essay of the <em>Genealogy</em> is quite explicitly about “the
        triumph of Judeo-Christian slave morality over the Greek/Roman master
        morality” (<a href="#bibliography">Gemes, 192</a>). The second essay
        shifts the focus a little closer to home, with its arguments on
        conscience (more recognisable to modern readers than some aristocratic
        distinction of sets of values), but still ostensibly chooses to focus on
        ancient believers of God. The third essay is where Nietzsche begins to
        let on to his reader that his critique is, in fact, of modernity. As
        Gemes argues, it is here that Nietzsche begins to criticise the modern,
        post-religious ideals of “truth, objectivity, and science” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >193</a
        >) as the most recent manifestation of the ascetic ideal. Even here,
        however, Nietzsche is far from explicit in calling out his readers.
        According to Gemes, “[i]t is in GM III:23 that we find ourselves for the
        first time more directly addressed” (<a href="#bibliography">ibid.</a>):
        the first 22 sections focus instead on religious and historical
        ascetism. A genealogical account, then, must be critically important to
        this project, if much of the book is framed by one. Through Gemes’
        reading, it becomes clear that genealogy <em>is</em> foundational to the
        text—just not in a historical way. The potency of Nietzsche’s critique
        relies on its ability to slip past his reader’s defences, so they grow
        to abhor the sort of life-denying ascetism he is criticising,
        <em>before</em> realising they embody it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last four sections of the second treatise are particularly
        interesting in light of this as they parallel the end of GM P:1 when
        Nietzsche stops himself from being too frank with his reader. GM II:22
        has a strong emphasis on God, religion, and the early Jews’
        internalization of drives. Nietzsche makes it seem like believing in a
        life-denying metaphysics of an afterlife is an essential pre-requisite
        to internalization, as it redirects attention from the world around us,
        to the promise of a world beyond our own. GM II:23 talks about the
        ancient Greeks, and how their religious metaphysics helped them keep
        “bad conscience at arm’s length”: this is again historical, but perhaps
        Nietzsche expects his reader to draw more of an analogy between herself
        and the Greeks than with the Jews.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a change of tone in section 24, where Nietzsche says that “[w]e
        modern humans, we are the heirs of millennia of conscience-vivisection
        and cruelty to the animal-self … For all too long man has regarded his
        natural inclinations with an ‘evil eye,’ so that in him they have
        finally become wedded to ‘bad conscience’” (<a href="#bibliography"
          >GM II:24</a
        >). This contrasts section 22’s implication that bad conscience—a result
        of the internalization of drives—requires some religious metaphysics
        through which to moralise bad drives; for the first time in the second
        essay, Nietzsche accuses modernity of the same unhealthy behaviour. This
        section betrays Nietzsche’s subterranean criticism of the reader, with
        his repeated use of “us” and “we”, and his situating the critique in
        “this decaying self-doubting present”, and “today” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >GM II:24</a
        >).
      </p>

      <p>
        Tomasello’s (<a href="#bib-toma2008">2008</a>) usage-based theory argues
        grammatical structures arise from using words: linguistic structures are
        constructed by communicating meaning. We can see this hierarchy by
        observing how infants communicate. According to Tomasello, “human
        infants communicate in some fairly sophisticated ways before they have
        acquired any linguistic conventions” (<a href="#bib-toma2009"
          >2009, 70</a
        >), for example by pointing and gesturing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Towards the end of the section, Nietzsche says “… this bell-stroke of
        noon … that makes the will free again” (<a href="#bibliography"
          >GM II:24</a
        >). This parallels the “twelve strokes of noon” that leave the
        “self-absorbed person” of the first section of the preface—the stranger
        to them self—rubbing their ears and asking, “who are we actually” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >GM P:1</a
        >): Nietzsche is talking about us. As with the restricting ellipsis at
        the end of GM P:1, Nietzsche catches himself in section 25: “—But what
        am I saying? Enough! Enough! At this point there is only one thing
        fitting for me, to be silent” (<a href="#bibliography">GM II:25</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        A reading of Nietzsche’s genealogy as “intentionally misleading,” (<a
          href="#bibliography"
          >Gemes, 191</a
        >) and of his real target in the <em>Genealogy</em> being modern readers
        and their post-religious scientific ideals makes sense of these uncanny
        lines, and is coherent with the <em>Genealogy’s</em> closing critique of
        the will to truth and science as ascetic. Through such a lens,
        Nietzsche’s history as outlined in the first treatise is an
        intentionally deceptive one, to win him the allegiance of his
        contemporary anti-Semitic audience. While Nietzsche could be trying to
        be historically accurate at times, it isn’t fundamentally important to
        his argument that he is, and with this in mind, Nietzsche’s critique of
        morality is still grounded and pertinent, even if his history is wrong.
        This is because his real target—as revealed towards the end of the third
        treatise—is modernity and its unceasing will to truth. The unnerving
        sections in the preface and at the end of the second treatise are clues
        Nietzsche leaves behind for the reader who has read past GM III:22, who
        comes back "<em>afterwards</em>" and ask[s], completely amazed,
        completely disconcerted, ‘what did we actually experience just now?’”
        (<a href="#bibliography">GM P:1</a>).
      </p>

      <p class="break">*</p>

      <p>
        Readers of the <em>Genealogy</em> as historical must justify the one
        consistency in Nietzsche’s history: its ambiguity. There’s no reason for
        Nietzsche to deliberately speak ‘in between the lines’ if his intention
        was to reveal some disturbing historical truths, and then ground a
        critique of morality on that revelation. A critique of morality
        understood as grounded on Nietzsche’s second-order values of
        life-affirmation and denial, then, is more compelling than one grounded
        historically (for a note on how <em>these</em> might be defined, see
        n2), but leaves open the question as to why the book is framed as a
        genealogical exercise in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        As such, Nietzsche’s genealogy is best understood as rhetorical, or
        polemical. Not only does the proposal that morality can have a history
        undermine its authority and ontological status, but through a carefully
        crafted historical narrative, Nietzsche is able to use his genealogical
        account as a façade behind which he hides the real subject of his
        critique—the reader. By shrouding his genuine critique with a
        genealogical narrative that is intentionally historically ambiguous,
        Nietzsche appeals to as many readers as possible, inviting them to fill
        in the gaps. There’s a limit to how inclusive Nietzsche could have been,
        however, and as such from a modern vantage point, his focus on the Jews
        and anti-Semitic tone seem to be a transparent appeal to the xenophobic
        inclinations of his contemporaries, instead of sincere history.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this way, genealogy is not historical for Nietzsche, but it is
        crucial to his project. It is only under the cover of genealogy that
        Nietzsche’s real critique can become pertinent in his readers, and can
        begin to dismantle within them their life-denying attitudes. A view of
        genealogy in this way means that Nietzsche’s historical inaccuracy (or
        apathy) does not undermine the <em>Genealogy’s</em> overall critique of
        morality Further, a reading of Nietzsche’s genealogy as deceptive makes
        sense of his oscillatory tone throughout the <em>Genealogy</em>, as well
        as the disconcerting claims of misdirection in the book’s
        <em>Ecce Homo</em> chapter. Through the lens of deceptive genealogy,
        sections such as those in the beginning of the preface, and at the end
        of the second treatise make sense as allusions to Nietzsche’s real
        critique, and serve to make sure the critique of his reader is properly
        absorbed.
